I am a postdoctoral scholar hosted jointly by [Richard Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/) at the Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge and [Ashwin Pananjady](https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/) at the Schools of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Tech, where I am the Gary C. Butler Family Postdoctoral Fellow.  Previously, I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, where I was advised by [Andrea Montanari](https://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/).  

I am broadly interested in problems at the intersection of optimization, statistics, and computational complexity.  In particular, I am interested in understanding both statistical and computational aspects of learning from random (as opposed to worst case) data.


*Note:* I previously published under the name Kabir Aladin Chandrasekher. 

**In Fall 2025, I will join the University of Southern California (USC) as an assistant professor in the Department of Data Sciences and Operations**
