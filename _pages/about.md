I am a postdoctoral scholar hosted jointly by [Richard Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/) at the Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge and [Ashwin Pananjady](https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/) at the Schools of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Tech, where I am the Gary C. Butler Family Postdoctoral Fellow.  Previously, I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, where I was advised by [Andrea Montanari](https://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/).  

I am broadly interested in problems at the intersection of optimization, statistics, and computational complexity.  In particular, I am interested in understanding both statistical and computational aspects of learning from random (as opposed to worst case) data.  Most of my recent work has focused on providing sharp, algorithm-specific guarantees for various nonconvex optimization problems with random data.

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.** You can find my CV [here](https://kabirverchand.github.io/assets/pdf/cv_kav.pdf).

*Note:* I previously published under the name Kabir Aladin Chandrasekher.
