Prior to this, I held postdoctoral appointments at the University of Cambridge in the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics and at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the Industrial and Systems Engineering department. Before that, I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University and a BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley.</p> <p>I am broadly interested in problems at the intersection of optimization, statistics, and computational complexity and am happy to chat about any and all of these.</p> <p><em>Note:</em> I previously published under the name Kabir Aladin Chandrasekher.</p> <h3 id="selected-recent-publications-see-all">Selected recent publications (see <a href="https://kabirverchand.github.io/publications">all</a>)</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Celentano, M., Cheng, C., Pananjady, A., and Verchand, K.A.
